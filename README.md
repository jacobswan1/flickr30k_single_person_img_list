# flickr30k_single_person_img_list
List of images from the [Flickr30k](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities/) dataset with only a single person in the view.

Flickr30k dataset is being used for benchmarking or checking the viability of various tasks related to vision and language. Sometimes it might be the case that all you require is a single person in the image for doing poc for some task. Faced with a similar problem, I wanted to use images only with a single person.

Parsing the text and finding the entities from it helped in narrowing down some of the images but there still remained images with either persons way in the background and not completely visible or reflection of the person or some paininting in the image other than the person being mentioned in the text.

Thus I manually tried to get ~2k images with only a single person and the  `.txt` file is that list. I hope others can come up with some interesting way of using this information. 

Use of these images must respect the corresponding terms of use by the [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/help/terms) dataset.
